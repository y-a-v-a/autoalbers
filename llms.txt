# AutoAlbers - Generative Art Tribute to Josef Albers

## About

AutoAlbers is an internet art piece created by y-a-v-a.org aka Vincent Bruijn that creates animated tributes to Josef Albers' "Homage to the Square" series. The application generates nested square compositions using algorithmic color schemes and presents them in a continuously evolving display.

## Creator
- y-a-v-a.org (https://www.y-a-v-a.org) also known as Vincent Bruijn

## Core Functionality

The application creates layered square compositions with 4 nested squares, each using colors from algorithmically generated color schemes. Every 12 seconds, a new composition is generated with fresh colors and arrangements, accompanied by a progress bar animation.
